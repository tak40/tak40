### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

**`Front-End Developer in Training | Currently Enrolled in Scrimba's Bootcamp Program`**

Welcome to my GitHub! I'm currently a student at Scrimba's Bootcamp, working towards completing my Front-End Developer curriculum. At present, my core focus is on JavaScript and React, but post-graduation, I plan to dive into back-end technologies with an aim to become a Full-Stack Developer. I'm particularly intrigued by the intersection of coding, AI, and Web3, and am always seeking a healthy balance among these aspects. Thanks for stopping by!
